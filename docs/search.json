    "text": "CONCLUSION\nFigure 1 is showing the top 10 states of United States with highest milk production.\nFrom the above Table 1, we can see that the consumption of fluid milk is decreasing each year and percentage of milk for manufacturing other milk produced is increasing. Therefore, we can conclude that gradually, over the years, people have started preferring solid milk products over fluid milk."
